The compiler is used by calling the DYERCompiler batch file 
from the commandprompt with two arguments. 
The first arguments is the source code and the second is the name of your robot

Eg. compiling a soruce code with the filename "Robotcode.txt" and naming the robot
"MyFirstRobot" the command would look be:

DYERCompiler Robotcode.txt MyFirstRobot

This produces a MyFirstRobot.java file, a MyFirstRobot.class file and a MyFirstRobot.jar file.
The .java file is the code generated by the DYERCompiler and the .class file
is the file produces by the Javacc compiler that needs to be installed on your machine.
The .jar file is robot to be imported into Robotcode, if that dosen't work, you can copy
in the code from the .java file into a new robot in Robocode.
